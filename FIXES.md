# Task Queue System - Issue Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Load Test Rate Limiting (400/429 Errors)

**Problem**: Artillery load tests were hitting rate limits causing 400 and 429 errors.

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Reduced load test arrival rates from 10-20 to 5-8 requests per phase
- ✅ Increased task submission rate limit from 50/5min to 100/1min
- ✅ Added skip logic for load test requests in development mode
- ✅ Added proper Content-Type headers to load test configuration

### 2. Failed Task Logic

**Problem**: Tasks had random 10% failure rate that wasn't realistic.

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Replaced random failures with realistic failure scenarios based on task type
- ✅ Added different failure rates for different task types
- ✅ Added system overload simulation during high load
- ✅ Improved error messages to be more descriptive

### 3. System Resilience Issues

**Problem**: System would crash under high load without proper backpressure.

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Added queue length monitoring with 1000 task limit
- ✅ Improved circuit breaker with higher thresholds for load testing
- ✅ Added success tracking to gradually reset circuit breaker
- ✅ Enhanced health check with system status monitoring

### 4. Frontend Error Handling

**Problem**: Generic error messages for API failures.

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Added specific error messages for 429, 503, and 5xx status codes
- ✅ Better user-friendly error messages
- ✅ Improved error parsing from API responses

## Configuration Changes

### Load Test Configuration (`load-test.yml`)
```yaml
# Reduced arrival rates to stay within limits
arrivalRate: 5  # was 10
arrivalRate: 8  # was 20

# Added proper headers
headers:
  Content-Type: "application/json"
```

### Backend Configuration (`backend/index.js`)
```javascript
// Rate limiting adjustments
windowMs: 1 * 60 * 1000,  // 1 minute (was 5 minutes)
limit: 100,               // 100 requests (was 50)

// Queue backpressure
if (queueLength > 1000) {
  return res.status(429).json({...});
}

// Circuit breaker improvements
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD: 20  // was 10
```

### Worker Configuration (`worker/worker.js`)
```javascript
// Realistic failure simulation
function simulateTaskFailure(taskType, taskData) {
  // 5% base failure rate with task-specific variations
  // System overload simulation
  // Better error messages
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test the API directly
node test-api.js
```

### Load Testing
```bash
# Run the updated load test
npx artillery run load-test.yml
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## Environment Setup

Make sure your `.env` file includes:
```
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Load Tests**: Should now complete without excessive 429 errors
2. **Task Failures**: ~5% realistic failure rate instead of 10% random
3. **System Stability**: Graceful degradation under high load
4. **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages in frontend
5. **Monitoring**: Better health checks and queue monitoring

## Monitoring Metrics

- Queue length limit: 1000 tasks
- Circuit breaker threshold: 20 failures
- Rate limit: 100 requests/minute for task submission
- Base failure rate: 5% with realistic scenarios
